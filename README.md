  <h3>Advanced SAR Image Processing Suite: Colorization, Crop Classification & Flood Detection</h3>
</div>

## üì° Overview

SARS (Synthetic Aperture Radar Analysis & Recognition System) is a comprehensive cross-platform application for processing and analyzing SAR imagery using state-of-the-art deep learning models. The system offers three main functionalities:

1. **SAR Image Colorization**: Transform grayscale SAR imagery into natural-looking colorized representations using Pix2Pix GAN
2. **Crop Classification**: Identify and classify agricultural areas using Vision Transformer (ViT) models
3. **Flood Detection**: Accurately detect and map flood-affected areas using the UNTER architecture

This multi-functional toolkit bridges the gap between raw SAR data and actionable insights for environmental monitoring, disaster response, and agricultural management.
